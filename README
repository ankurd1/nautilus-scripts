A set of nautilus scripts that I wrote for daily use!
Copy these files to your nautilus-scripts folder and make them executable.
For ubuntu, this folder is ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts.

Now, just right click on any file in nautilus and choose one of the scripts
to execute!

convert_to_mp3.py
----------------
Converts the selected files to mp3.
Dependancies: ffmpeg

Hex Dump
--------
Shows a hex dump of the file.

SendToIphone
------------
Sends the selected file to your iphone/ipod/ipad over wifi.
Needs a jailbroken device with openssh installed.

A typical use case is to send an ipa file to the installous directory! ;)

Uses a config file to store configuration options. Refer to 
SendToIphone.cfg.sample to understand what the options do.

Dependencies: zenity, paramiko
